         IndependenceDay in India is a national holiday celebrated every year on
         August 15th. It commemorates the day when India gained independence
         from British colonial rule in 1947. This historic event marked the end
         of a struggle for freedom that lasted for decades and paved the way for
         the establishment of the modern Indian nation. Here's some information
         about Independence Day in India: **Historical Context:** India was
         under British colonial rule for nearly 200 years, starting from the
         18th century. The Indian independence movement gained momentum in the
         late 19th and early 20th centuries, with various leaders and movements
         advocating for self-governance and freedom from British oppression.
         **Key Figures:** Several notable leaders played pivotal roles in
         India's struggle for independence, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal
         Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and many others.
         Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha,
         became a cornerstone of the movement. **Timeline:** - August 15, 1947:
         India gained independence from British rule, and the Indian
         Independence Act 1947 was enacted. The act created two independent
         nations, India and Pakistan. - Jawaharlal Nehru, who later became
         India's first Prime Minister, hoisted the Indian national flag at the
         Red Fort in Delhi on this day. **Independence Day Celebrations:**
         Independence Day is celebrated with great enthusiasm and patriotism
         across India. The most iconic celebration takes place at the Red Fort
         in Delhi, where the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag
         and delivers a speech to the nation. This event is attended by
         thousands of people and broadcasted live on television and radio. Other
         celebrations and events that take place on Independence Day include: -
         Flag hoisting ceremonies at various government offices, schools,
         colleges, and public places. - Cultural programs, parades, and
         performances showcasing India's diverse heritage. - Patriotic songs,
         speeches, and skits that reflect on the country's struggle for freedom
         and its progress since independence. - People wearing clothes in the
         colors of the Indian flag (saffron, white, and green) to show their
         pride and unity. **Symbolism:** The Indian national flag, known as the
         "Tricolour," holds significant symbolism. The saffron color represents
         courage and sacrifice, the white color symbolizes truth and purity, and
         the green color represents growth and prosperity. The Ashoka Chakra, a
         wheel with 24 spokes, is at the center of the flag and symbolizes
         progress and eternal life. Independence Day in India is not just a
         celebration of freedom but also a reminder of the sacrifices made by
         countless individuals to secure the nation's future. It's a day of
         unity, pride, and reflection on India's journey as a sovereign nation.Ë€
